       A two-line paragraph would consist of two complete sentences, each 
       indented at the start and ending with a period, and the second sentence 
       beginning with a capital letter, to convey a single idea or point.</p>

      <br>

   <p> The primary goal of such a short paragraph is to briefly develop a 
     controlling idea, much like the example about piranhas from The University 
     of North Carolina at Chapel  </p>
